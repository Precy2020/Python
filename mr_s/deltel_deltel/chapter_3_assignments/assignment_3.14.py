# (Challenge: Approximating the Mathematical Constant ) Write a script that computes
# the value of π from the following infinite series. Print a table that shows the value of
# π approximated by one term of this series, by two terms, by three terms, and so on. How
# many terms of this series do you have to use before you first get 3.14? 3.141? 3.1415?
# 3.14159?
# 3.14
# 4 4 4 4 4
# π = 4 – - + --- – - + - – ------ + …
